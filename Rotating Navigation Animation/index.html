          Control can sometimes be an illusion. But sometimes you need illusions
          to gain control. Fantasy is an easy way to give meaning to the world.
          To cloak our harsh reality with escapist comfort. After all, isn't
          that why we surround ourselves with so many screens? So we can avoid
          seeing? So we can avoid each other? So we can avoid truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          The world itself's just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our
          running commentary of bullshit, masquerading as insight, our social
          media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this? Not with
          our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money.
          I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because
          Hunger Games books make us happy, but because we wanna be sedated.
          Because it's painful not to pretend, because we're cowards.

          They showed themselves, the top 1% of the 1%, the ones in control, the
          ones who play God without permission. And now I'm gonna take them
          down.

          Every relationship is a power struggle. Some of us need to be
          controlled.

          How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, when it's as much
          a part of me as I am?

          There are some people out there… And it doesn’t happen a lot. It’s
          rare. But they refuse to let you hate them. In fact, they care about
          you in spite of it. And the really special ones, they’re relentless at
          it. Doesn’t matter what you do to them. They take it and care about
          you anyway. They don’t abandon you, no matter how many reasons you
          give them. No matter how much you’re practically begging them to
          leave. And you wanna know why? Because they feel something for me that
          I can’t… They love me.

          What if changing the world was just about being here, by showing up no
          matter how many times we get told we don’t belong, by staying true
          even when we’re shamed into being false, by believing in ourselves
          even when we’re told we’re too different? And if we all held on to
          that, if we refuse to budge and fall in line, if we stood our ground
          for long enough, just maybe… The world can’t help but change around
          us.

          Maybe wars aren’t meant to be won, maybe they’re meant to be

          I do see the beauty in the rules, the invisible code of chaos hiding
          behind the menacing face of order.

          I’ve never found it hard to hack most people. If you listen to them,
          watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into
          their heads.

        <p>
          …I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way
          to disappoint.

          It's one thing to question your mind; it's another to question your
          eyes and ears. But, then again, isn't it all the same? Our senses just
          mediocre inputs to our brain? Sure, we rely on them, trust they
          accurately portray the real world around us, but what if the haunting
          truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at
          all, but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a
          garbled reality, a truly fuzzy picture we will never make out?

          Annihilation is always the answer. We destroy parts of ourselves every
          day. We Photoshop our warts away. We edit the parts we hate about
          ourselves, modify the parts we think people hate. We curate our
          identity, carve it, distill it. Krista's wrong. Annihilation is all we
          are.
